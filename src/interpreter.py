# FUA: 
# - write python code that iterates through the list and replace each word if necessary in groff / markdown / latex
# - interpreter will need to actively handle the count of each kind of stylised word since we are not distinguishing between left and right for any styling option
# - eventually incorporate a bash script that automatically calls the ooe interpreter with the 'ooe{version_number}' command called in terminal
